# Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App

This is a basic native Android application built with ChartIQ's Android Charting SDK. 
This provides an example of how to implement the most common elements in the library. This is not a comprehensive example, more like a good starting point for an Android developer.

## About the Android Charting SDK

The Android Charting SDK has been designed to support this basic application and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations.
This can be done by adding additional java code to invoke Javascript functions directly. 
Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

* a valid version of ChartIQ's charting library (version 6.0 or greater). Please contact sales@chartiq.com if you do not already have a license or evaluation version.

* A current Android Charting SDK. Download from https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App/blob/master/chartiq-release/chartiq-release.aar
