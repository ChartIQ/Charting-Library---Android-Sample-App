# Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App

This is a basic Android application built with ChartIQ's Android Charting SDK. 
Both the native SDK and this application are intended to provide guidance on how to implement a native Android app that interacts with the most common API calls in the [javaScript library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).


## About the Android Charting SDK

The Android Charting SDK has been designed to support this basic application and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations.
This can be done by adding additional java code to invoke Javascript functions directly. 
Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

* A valid version of ChartIQ's charting library (Version 7.0.3 or greater). Please contact sales@chartiq.com if you do not already have a license or evaluation version.

* A current Android Charting SDK. Download from https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App/blob/master/chartiq-release/chartiq-release.aar

* Minimum Android OS version is Nougat/7.0 - API 24, or last currently supported version.
